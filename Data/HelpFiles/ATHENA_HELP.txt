Welcome to the ATHENA help page!

To get started here is the basic profile and functionality of the GAN:

GAN runs on PyTorch APIs

 -- ABSTRACT:
A Generative Adversarial Network is a set of two neural networks designed to generate
some form of data based on what is received as a data set. GANs can replicate a variety
if different forms of media from images, to music, to poems. ATHENA, as of April 4th 2019
is designed solely to work with images.

===== SECTION 1.0 GETTING STARTED =====
To begin, you may want to familiarize yourself with the environment.

===== SECTION 1.1 PYTHON INSTALLATION =====

Python Installation:
ATHENA is written entirely in Python and will need Python interpreters in order to run. Visit Python.org
to install Python, as well as pip. You will need it later.

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
WARNING: ENSURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT PYTHON 32/64BIT ARCHITECTURE INSTALLED OR PYTORCH WILL NOT WORK.
!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!

===== SECTION 1.2 PYTORCH INSTALLATION =====
PyTorch Installation:
As said above ATHENA functions with the powerful PyTorch GAN API. Before running anything it is recommended
to install the PyTorch library from the website, linked below:

===== SECTION 2.0 FAMILIARIZATION =====

===== SECTION 2.1 IMPORTING A data set =====
Importing a data set:
To import a data set, simply click file in the menu bar, then click the import data set
menu button. This will open the import data set tab.

File >> Import data set

As a word of warning, ATHENA only takes data sets in the format of cifar, mnist, stl10, lsun, and imagenets.
As of April 4th 2019, no other data set formats are supported.

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
WARNING: Remember to look over your data set as it is displayed in the import tab's output log, this will
ensure that your data is labeled, and formatted correctly for proper GAN execution!

===== SECTION 2.2 TRAINING AND GAN EXECUTION =====

=== SECTION 2.2.1 SELECTING A DATA SET ===
Training the GAN on a data set is the heart of this application. To begin, you will want to select which data set
you wish to train off of.

<Insert image of data set drop down menu>

NOTE: ATHENA comes pre-packaged with a provided data set. You may use this as you wish within the application, but be
advised this data set is a cifar100 data set with over 10,000 images to train off of. The usual ETA for this training
session is anywhere from 24 to 48 hours of non stop training.

=== SECITON 2.2.2 CHOOSING EPOCHS ===

Epochs in a GAN is how many cycles of training the GAN will go through on a particular imagents results tab
