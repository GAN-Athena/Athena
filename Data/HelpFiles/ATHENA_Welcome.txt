Welcome to the ATHENA Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Tutorial Application!

ABSTRACT:
    This application is designed to help professionals, hobbyists, and the curious alike understand the inner workings
    of a Generative Adversarial Network.

How it works:
    ATHENA works with PyTorch, and PyQt5 to create a wrapped, and isolated GAN that accepts imported image data sets.
    These data sets are then sent through the GAN where they are scanned with Pytorch image recognition software, and
    generated into new images based on the data set provided. These new images are then determined to be real or fake
    via the internal discriminator within the PyTorch GAN, thus creating a generative adversarial network of neural
    networks.

    Eventually, the discriminator can no longer determine what is real, or faked by the generator. When this happens, the
    GAN will begin to save the generated images as a new image of the same data set format provided. This new image data
    will then be displayed on screen in a new tab for the you to observe, and laugh at the absurdity of. During the
    execution process, ATHENA will display GAN specific data such as Loss over time, an ETA, and a host of graphs that
    the user can choose to display as needed. This is to show in real time, how the GAN executes in a way that enables
    a basic understanding of the data, and how it is manipulated by the GAN to create a new form of data.
